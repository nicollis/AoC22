# Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ‰

Every year I like to spend time in Advent of Code learning some new tech.

Last year I did the problems all on Arduino using C.

This year I am wanting to dive into Go Lang as Go seems to be the rising star in the backend services world.

An added challenge this year I'll have a baby just born a few days before the AoC kick off. However, I'm excited to 
spend some time learning Go even in a sleep-deprived state. Hopefully my solutions won't suffer too much
from the challenges of a newborn, in addition to a new language.
